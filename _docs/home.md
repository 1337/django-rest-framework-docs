Django Rest Framework Docs (DRF Docs) allows you to list all your API Endpoints that inherit from <a href="http://www.django-rest-framework.org/" target="_blank">Django Rest Framework</a>. Its purpose is to work out of the box and it should take a minimum to install it.

<h4>How It Works</h4>

The concept is pretty simple. Once you [install it](/docs/installation/) you should go the the url you set (ie. `http://0.0.0.0:/8000/docs/`) and you should see all your API endpoints along with the serializer fields, allowed methods etc for each one.

You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight python %}
def hello_drf_docs(self):
  print('Hello DRFdocs!')
{% endhighlight %}
